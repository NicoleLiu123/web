<h2> Innate Immunity </h2> 
 The Immune System is a very interesting body system that is crucial for a living person. The Innate Immune system consists of your skin, mucous
membranes,your stomach and your white blood cells. Usually a pathogen gets into your body through a cut or through your mouth/nose. If the pathogen 
gets through from your nose then usually it will be stopped by your nose hairs, however,if it gets through then it will end up going to your stomach. 
Since your stomach is so acidic, usaully the pathogen will end up dying. If the pathogen gets in through a cut then, neutrophils, which are
 white blood cells will engulf the microbes during phagocytosis. Additionally, the inflammatory system is also triggered and will lead to the release of 
 histamines which causes the dilation and permeability of capillaries so that the phagocytic cells and clotting factors are able to travel faster 
 to the infected area. This inflammation causes fever. </p>

<h2> Adaptive Immunity </h2>
The Adaptive Immune system is very important. There are two types, humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity are the B cells
and deals with pathogens that are circulating outside of the cells. An antigen will end up binding to a B cell and activate it and this activation 
can be enhanced by cytokines. The B cell will then begin to clone itself and two types of cells form. Effector cells or memory cells. Effector B cells
will produce antibodies that are specific to the antigen and cause the pathogens to clump up so that it is easier for white blood cells to engulf.
Memory B cells live for a longer time and they contain receptors for the same antigen, which allows them to mount an immune response more quickly
in future infections. Cellular immunity occurs when pathogens have infected body cells. T cells are activated by the antigens and will also clone 
itself into cytotoxic T cells or memory T cells. The cytotoxic T cells destory infected body cells while the memory T cells contain receptors for 
the antigen. Each T cell or B cell inly encodes the receptors to identify one type of antigen, which is why it takes so long at first to fight
off a pathogen. Afterwards, the immune system should react fairly fast and there might not be any symptoms. </p>

<h2> Passive Immunity and Malfunctions of the Immune System </h2>
Passive Immunity occurs when a person recieves antibodies from another person. This can occur when feeding breast milk to infants or through the
placenta. While this type of immmunity is helpful if you're trying to fight off a pathogen, you will still be vulnerable the next time this pathogen
infects you because you have not made any memory cells to help combat the pathogens. Allergies occur when your immune system malfunctions. The 
immune system identifies antigens of certain foods or objects that are not harmful to be harmful. And this causes an inflammatory response in order
to fight off what it percieves to be a dangerous pathogen when it is really just something hermless. Another malfunction is when your immune system
starts to fight its own cells because it no longer percieves the body cells to be part of itself. This causes autoimmune disorders.</p>
